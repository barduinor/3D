# Summary

Another raspberry pi 2 or 3 case for the collection.  

If you cant print yourself or don't want epic logo on the side you can order from here
https://www.etsy.com/listing/555544754

Insert is self standing if wanted to be used on its own without the cover.  It has four csink holes in the base if desired to mount to wall or other vertical surface.

If installing fan and fan cover, install those onto the cover before inserting insert with pi.

Stand is not required.  Allows more stability if the case is stood up on end.  I also found it is a tight enough fit that you could actually mount the stand to something and the case cover will stay in place.

Uses a 40mm x 40mm x 10mm fan  -  and still would be enough room for a 1/2" tall heatsink on main cpu of pi.  

You also can go without a fan since there is a fan cover to cover the area for a fan.

4 - #5 or 6 x .5" long flat head screws. < -- only required if using fan guard
2 - 3mm x .375 - .5" long screws to attach and align pi in insert.  <--- this is not required

I have free models and paid models.  Free models are nice but tips are appreciated greatly.

Update 11.5.17 - A user contacted me and said they knocked off the wireless antenna on the pi due to the insert channel doesn't allow enough room for it. Looking into it now.  I have removed that file for now.  I will reupload shortly.

I have added more relief by the antenna portion of the pi 3.  All users should use the R2Pi2 insert R1 to help prevent any damage to their PI.  I did not have this issue during prototyping but I could see how it could have happened.  You have been warned.

Update 11.30.17 - a user mention the pins don't line up correctly when snapping cover over insert.  Added R2Pi2 - Insert R2.  This insert is undersized .030 to help with that issue.  Looks to work really well to open up more tolerance.  I am removing the original Insert R1 to keep the files simple.



# Print Settings


Notes: 
Print the insert right side up

Print the cover on its end - best if the power input of the cover is to the bed.
